# reb -- Regular Expression Beautiful

To make infomation extraction with patterns easier, reb tries to improve traditional re in some ways:

+ Readability -- multiline patterns are allowed
+ Reusability -- name a pattern and it could be used in another pattern
+ Maintainability -- examples come with patterns to show how patterns were made

Check `usage.py` for examples

## todo list

+ clause confliction check
+ alg improvement
+ better parse tree interface
+ show patterns in graph
